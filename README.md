# 🏥 Comparative Analysis of BERT and ClinicalBERT for Hospital Readmission Prediction

A comprehensive study comparing general-purpose BERT with domain-specific ClinicalBERT for predicting hospital readmissions. This project demonstrates how specialized medical language models outperform general models in healthcare applications.

## 📘 Overview

Hospital readmission prediction is a critical healthcare challenge. This project evaluates whether domain-specific pretraining on clinical notes improves model performance compared to general-purpose language models.

**Key Findings:**
- ClinicalBERT consistently outperforms BERT across all metrics
- Domain-specific pretraining provides significant advantages for medical text
- Clinical language understanding is crucial for accurate healthcare predictions

## 🎯 Objectives

- Fine-tune BERT (bert-base-uncased) on hospital readmission data
- Fine-tune ClinicalBERT (emilyalsentzer/Bio_ClinicalBERT) on the same dataset
- Compare performance using comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Analyze the impact of domain-specific pretraining on clinical tasks

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Pre-trained model implementation
- **Scikit-learn**: Model evaluation and metrics
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization and performance plotting

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The models are compared using:
- **Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
- **Precision & Recall**: Detailed performance breakdown

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bert-clinicalbert-comparison
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Ensure patient data is in the required format
2. **Run training**:
   ```bash
   python train_models.py
   ```
3. **Evaluate results**:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## 📈 Results

| Model | Accuracy | F1-Score | AUC |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|
| BERT | 78.5% | 0.76 | 0.82 |
| ClinicalBERT | **84.2%** | **0.82** | **0.89** |

**Key Insight**: ClinicalBERT's pretraining on clinical notes (MIMIC-III) provides a ~6% accuracy improvement and better understanding of medical terminology and context.

## 🔬 Model Details

### BERT (bert-base-uncased)
- General-purpose language model
- Trained on Wikipedia and BookCorpus
- 110M parameters
- No medical domain knowledge

### ClinicalBERT (Bio_ClinicalBERT)
- Specialized for clinical text
- Pretrained on MIMIC-III clinical notes
- Fine-tuned on medical terminology and patterns
- Better understanding of healthcare context

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Hospital Resource Planning**: Predict readmission risk to optimize bed allocation
- **Preventive Care**: Identify high-risk patients for intervention programs
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduce healthcare costs by preventing unnecessary readmissions
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Aid healthcare providers in treatment planning
